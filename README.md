# flash-card-study
Don't have any index cards around? Use this as a substitute

I created this little project as I was learning Python. The course I was following instructed me to use some index cards to
learn some terminology. I did not have any on hand so I figured I would code my own! This this little project was born, and
it has slowly expanded to more capabilities.

# How to run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed

Clone/download repo to a location on you computer

If you haven't already, open a terminal/powershell of choice

Navigate to the location of the project
> cd <project_path_location>

Run the program
> python FlashCards.py


## Using your own file
There is a sample .txt file that contains words to study

To use your own file:
> make sure it's a  .txt

> place it in the same location as the .py 

> one word per line

See sample.txt for example
